# Ecosystem Integration — Passkey, Relayer, Scaffold

Sub Rosa's live path uses **Ed25519 session keys + signed mandates** and
**direct Soroban RPC**. It also ships optional ecosystem adapters that do not
change the core protocol: Passkey-Kit in the web wallet panel, OpenZeppelin
Relayer Channels as an SDK submitter, and GOAT AgentKit for x402-paid agent
decisions.

## Authorization model mapping

| Demo (today) | Production (Passkey / Smart Account) |
| --- | --- |
| Principal G-address | Passkey-controlled OZ Smart Account |
| Session Ed25519 key | Policy signer or context rule scoped to Round contract |
| Signed mandate JSON | Smart Account spending limit + contract allowlist |
| Agent verifies caps off-chain | Wallet policy + agent double-check |
| Session signs commit + x402 | Session signer submits via RPC or relayer |
| GOAT agent decision | Policy-scoped AI agent action before commit |

The **mandate** is the off-chain stand-in for what Smart Account Kit encodes as **context rules** and **spending limits**.

## Passkey-Kit (legacy)

- npm: `passkey-kit`
- Demo: https://passkey-kit-demo.pages.dev/
- WebAuthn secp256r1 → Stellar smart wallet precursor
- **Note:** Kalepail recommends **smart-account-kit** for new projects

### When to use

Hackathon jury narrative: the Passkey tab runs **passkey-kit** in-browser — **Create passkey** works on localhost without extra env (default testnet WASM hash is embedded).

## Smart Account Kit (recommended production path)

- npm: `smart-account-kit`
- Repo: https://github.com/kalepail/smart-account-kit
- Built on **OpenZeppelin Stellar Smart Accounts** (audited contracts)

### Features relevant to Sub Rosa agents

- **Passkey authentication** — principal never exports seed
- **Policy signers** — delegate session key with limits
- **Context rules** — restrict calls to Round contract + max amounts
- **Session persistence** — agent reconnect without re-prompting passkey every tx

### Integration sketch (not implemented in demo)

1. Principal creates smart account with passkey
2. Add policy signer = agent session key, limits = mandate caps
3. Agent runs same `runBidderAgent` flow but `secretKey` is policy signer
4. Optional: relayer sponsors fees

## OpenZeppelin Relayer (scored flex)

- Guide: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/relayer/1.3.x/guides/stellar-channels-guide
- Submits passkey-signed transactions without user holding XLM for fees

### Sub Rosa stance

| Path | Used in demo? | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct Soroban RPC | **Yes** | Proven in all e2e; simplest; no relayer dependency |
| OZ Relayer channels | Optional SDK submitter | Production UX for passkey wallets; fee sponsorship |

Relayer does **not** replace keeper or x402 facilitator — it only changes **who pays the Soroban fee** for a signed tx.

## Scaffold Stellar

- Repo: https://github.com/thebadass-dev/scaffold-stellar
- Standard Vite + Stellar app scaffold

Sub Rosa ships a **custom jury UI** (`apps/web`) rather than Scaffold, but the same stack applies: replace manual keypair with smart-account-kit for wallet connect.

## x402 + SAC alignment

Appraisal and GOAT agent decisions use **x402** as HTTP-gated
micro-payments. Prize settlement uses contract `settle()` over SAC transfers.
On testnet the payment/settlement asset is USDC; mainnet smoke uses native XLM
SAC. See `docs/TECH_DESIGN.md`.

## GOAT AgentKit

- npm: `@goatnetwork/agentkit`
- Local package: `packages/goat`
- API surface: `POST /goat/agent-decision`, protected by x402
- Hosted demo surface: `POST /goat/paid-agent-decision`, a backend relay that
  pays the protected route with a funded Stellar testnet demo payer

GOAT AgentKit is treated as an agent runtime boundary, not as the settlement
layer. Live GOAT tool execution requires credentials/faucet/API access; local
deterministic mode is labeled in the response for review and UI testing.
